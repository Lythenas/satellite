# Satellite

This is an attempt to create a [Rocket] based CMS (or at least blog) in Rust.

Currently this project doesn't do very much.

## Goals
- [ ] Easy to use CMS/Blog
- [ ] Theme-able
- [ ] Secure
- [ ] Fast
- [ ] Extensible

## TODO
- Add database support (with [diesel])
- Add more routes for viewing posts, users, pages, ...
- Build a backend

## Still Undecided
- Database structure
- Move configuration from `Satellite.toml` to database
- JS-framework for the backend
